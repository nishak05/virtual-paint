# virtual-paint
a paint site made by using hand movement detection
Developed a real-time virtual paint application using Python and OpenCV by integrating hand-tracking and gesture recognition for interactive drawing and selection.
Implemented fingertip landmark detection to differentiate between drawing (single finger) and selection (two fingers) modes, enabling seamless gesture-based canvas interaction.
